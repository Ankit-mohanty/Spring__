## Lifecycle Phases

### Instantiation:
The magic begins! Beans come to life through constructors or factory methods.

### Populating Properties:
Dependencies and properties injected – building connections!

### PreInitialization:
Inject personality! Apply custom logic before bean initialization.

### Initialization:
Lights, camera, action! The `@PostConstruct` or `afterPropertiesSet` methods kick in for custom initiation.

### PostInitialization:
Enhance the magic! Execute additional custom logic post bean initialization.

### Usage:
The spotlight is on! Beans are ready for their starring role in the application.

### Destruction:
Curtain call for singletons! The `@PreDestroy` or `destroy` method takes the stage during application shutdown.

## Customizing Bean Lifecycle

- 🛠️ Implement `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` interfaces.
- 🌈 Use `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotations for personalized initiation and destruction.
- 🎨 Implement `BeanPostProcessor` for fine-tuning control.
